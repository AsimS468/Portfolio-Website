                description="I recently completed my one-month virtual internship with Skyscanner through Forage. During this program, I worked as a frontend engineer where I built a web application using React. One of my main tasks was developing a date-picking page with Skyscannerâ€™s open-source Backpack React library. I also customized my application to improve usability and ran automated tests to make sure everything rendered correctly. This experience gave me valuable insight into frontend development practices and how large-scale companies structure their open-source tools."
